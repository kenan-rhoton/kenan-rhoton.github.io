      <description>Also known as &amp;ldquo;just hit accept, I checked it already!&amp;quot;.
The Code Review is a practice that dates back to ancient times when someone would finish writing some code (in this case the Hammurabi Code) and someone else would check to make sure they hadn&amp;rsquo;t made any stupid mistakes. So I guess you&amp;rsquo;ll understand me when I find it surprising we still do it wrong.
What do I mean by wrong?</description>

      <description>Red Green Refactor Repeat  Test Driven Development, also known as &amp;ldquo;this would be so cool if green started with an R&amp;rdquo;.
So this new (as in 1957) way of programming has been catching on lately, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had to clarify many points about what TDD is and isn&amp;rsquo;t. I want to talk about some things related to my vision of TDD (which might not be yours, and that&amp;rsquo;s ok).</description>

Python is a beautiful language.
Every language does have some kind of beauty to it (except for perhaps JavaScript), but Python really drives home the message that simplicity can be powerful.
It&amp;rsquo;s also incredibly deep, and it is probably the oldest designed language from the tribe of &amp;ldquo;We can make programming a creative experience.</description>

Rust is an amazing language.
True, I say every language is amazing (although begrudgingly with JavaScript), so that may not mean much, but Rust is something special.
It&amp;rsquo;s a language I could imagine replacing C.</description>

Go is a language that many people (yet not enough) are talking about.
Yes, it has the interesting origin of basically being designed by Google to solve Google&amp;rsquo;s problems. Yes, it looks at first glance like C with some random syntax changes.</description>
