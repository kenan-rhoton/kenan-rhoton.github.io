<p><a href="https://github.com/golang/go">Go</a> is a language that many people (yet not enough) are talking about.</p>

<p>Yes, it has the interesting origin of basically being designed by Google to solve Google&rsquo;s problems.
Yes, it looks at first glance like C with some random syntax changes.
And yes, why do you need to learn a new language to do the things you already know how to do?</p>

<p>But every language has its place, and today we&rsquo;re going to look at this beautiful construct (all languages are beautiful, really, except Javascript) and try to find the answer to the question of <em>When to Use Go</em>.</p>

<p>And it all starts with another question:</p>

<h2 id="what-is-go">What is Go?</h2>

<p>Go is a compiled language that strongly inherits from Alef and C.
However, it makes a special emphasis in some very interesting aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Fast compilation</li>
<li>Package management</li>
<li>Channel-based concurrency</li>
<li>Statically link everything</li>
<li>Code Clarity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>

<p>The first thing to understand about Go is that it is stupidly easy to learn.
Anyone with any programming experience can learn it at a competent level in under a week.</p>

<p>This is in great part to the amazing amount of emphasis the Golang team have put on a clear language.</p>

<p>For example, here is an excerpt from a random repo I&rsquo;ve been contributing to:</p>

<pre><code>  func InvertColorMap() {
    re := regexp.MustCompile(&quot;.*.fg&quot;)
    for k, _ := range ColorMap {
        if re.FindAllString(k, 1) != nil {
            ColorMap[k] = ui.ColorBlack
        }
    }
    ColorMap[&quot;par.text.hi&quot;] = ui.ColorWhite
  }
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really take a rocket scientist to realize that this code simply does:</p>

<ul>
<li>Declare a function InvertColorMap with no arguments that does the following:

<ol>
<li>Make a regexp for things ending in &ldquo;.fg&rdquo;</li>
<li>Iterate the keys of a <strong>ColorMap</strong> thing.</li>
<li>Find All Strings that match the <strong>Regex</strong> in the Key and if not nil, set that <strong>ColorMap</strong> key to ui.ColorBlack</li>
<li>Finally, set the specific key of &ldquo;par.text.hi&rdquo; in <strong>ColorMap</strong> to White</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations, you apparently already know Golang.</p>

<h3 id="fast-compilation">Fast Compilation</h3>

<p>Golang compiles <em>fast</em>. And I don&rsquo;t mean the &ldquo;Just one cup of coffe&rdquo; kind of fast. I mean &ldquo;are you sure this isn&rsquo;t just plain C&rdquo; fast.</p>

<p>As an example I timed the compilation of <a href="https://github.com/revel/revel">Revel</a>, one of the main Web Frameworks for Go (which is awesome, by the way) and the compilation took less than a second (specifically 0.879s of real time).</p>

<p>Granted, it&rsquo;s not the hugest app I could find, but it&rsquo;s a good representation I feel of a <em>useful app</em>.</p>

<p>As a bigger example, I also compiled the go compiler and its tools, and it took just 8m 20.068s, and about 40% of that was running the tests.</p>

<p>So if you care for fast compilation times, Go has your back, bro.</p>

<h3 id="package-management">Package Management</h3>

<p>Go has taken the trend started by Python&rsquo;s <code>pip</code> and Ruby&rsquo;s <code>gem</code>, and integrated the package management system into the standard toolchain in the form of <code>go get</code>.</p>

<p>This is, IMO a fantastic thing, as there is a standard way of organizing your dependencies. However, <code>go get</code> is not without its caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>go get</code> kinda forces you into a monorepo, where your code is always located in <code>$GOPATH/src/github.com/kenan-rhoton/foo-project</code> or similar.</li>
<li>It encourages a philisophy of always using the latest version of dependencies, which I find a good thing, but most people dont. You can opt out of that by vendoring the dependencies, but it&rsquo;s kinda ugly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some solutions have appeared that target these problems, chief among them is <a href="https://github.com/Masterminds/glide">Glide</a>, which essentially makes vendoring easy.</p>

<p>In most cases, though, this means that the only step to build a project is <code>go get -u github.com/user/repo</code>, which will automatically fetch the project and its dependencies, build it and install its binary (if any) into $GOPATH/bin.</p>

<h3 id="channel-based-concurrency">Channel-Based Concurrency</h3>

<p>Here we can see a big part of its Alef influence: channels.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Go way&rdquo; of doing concurrency is to simply launch a &ldquo;goroutine&rdquo; and communicate with it through blocking channels.</p>

<p>A quick example, since Go tends to be easier to understand by actually looking at code:</p>

<pre><code>import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
)

func main() {
    c := make(chan string)
    go func(i chan string) {
        i &lt;- &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
    }(c)
    fmt.Println(&lt;-c)
}
</code></pre>

<p>That is a complete Hello World program with concurrency.</p>

<p>Another cool feature in golang is that, although reading and writing to a channel is, in general, blocking, one can do a nonblocking read using the <code>select</code> construct:</p>

<pre><code>select {
    case res := &lt;-i:
        fmt.Println(res)
    default:
        fmt.Println(&quot;Received nothing yet!&quot;)
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="statically-link-everything">Statically link everything</h3>

<p>This is a funny one. I&rsquo;ve heard two kinds of arguments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Statically linking is a vestige of the 80s, dynamically link everything!</li>
<li>Statically linking is faster, clearer, cleaner and makes things not randomly break.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m in favor of the second one, so this section is a Go advantage in my mind, but feel free to disagree! (You can always open an issue at <a href="https://github.com/kenan-rhoton/kenan-rhoton.github.io">github</a>)</p>

<p>So Go compiles into a completely self-contained executable 100% of the time.
No worries about external things breaking it.
That has got to be good.</p>

<h3 id="code-clarity">Code Clarity</h3>

<p>This is one of my favorite things: Go includes tools such as <code>gofmt</code> and <code>go vet</code> which define the code style and best practices for the language.</p>

<p>In fact, Go likes Code Clarity so much that it won&rsquo;t even compile if you have an unused variable declared. Or unused package imported.</p>

<p>I love that many of these &ldquo;warnings&rdquo; have become compilation errors, forcing you to do what you should already be doing: coding correctly.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>go test</code> is something that is more and more prevalent in different languages, and that is an ingrained testing approach.</p>

<p>I particularly like that go encourages you to have your test files alongside the files they&rsquo;re testing (so <code>thing.go</code> would be tested by <code>thing_test.go</code> in the same directory).</p>

<h2 id="what-does-go-suck-at">What does Go suck at?</h2>

<p>Go, like every other language, is not perfect. In fact it has some very clear flaws:</p>

<ol>
<li>Development speed.</li>
<li>No real mature Game Development packages.</li>
<li>Embedded systems not really supported.</li>
<li>Error handling is weird</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="development-speed">Development speed</h3>

<p>This is where Go has sacrificed everything, pretty much. By following the <em>less is more</em> principle they&rsquo;ve created a beautiful understandable language where you have to put the more to get things done.</p>

<p>So pretty much everything you want to do in the language, you have to do yourself. And it will be very easy to do, yes. But it will also take time.</p>

<p>As an example, the language doesn&rsquo;t even have a <code>round</code> function in its Math library. But yeah, you can probably implement it in less than 10 lines of code, so who cares?</p>

<p>When you add all this, you reach a very weird conclusion: the time you save in searching documentation and stuff because the language is so easy to understand is simply traded in increased development time.</p>

<p>So Go is not a language for when you want to develop <em>fast</em>.</p>

<h3 id="no-real-gamedev">No real GameDev</h3>

<p>Aside from <a href="https://github.com/azul3d/engine">Azul3d</a> I&rsquo;m not really aware of any true 3D game engines, and it&rsquo;s still a very small project.</p>

<p>For 2D you have some other options, but nothing mature enough, really.</p>

<h3 id="embedded-systems">Embedded Systems</h3>

<p>Sure, you <em>can</em> use Go for Embedded Systems, just like you can use Java, but really, it&rsquo;s like trying to put on a very small shoe.</p>

<p>Just don&rsquo;t force it.</p>

<h3 id="error-handling-is-weird">Error handling is weird</h3>

<p>This is more of a style chose, but it puts many people off. This is a typical function call with error handling in Go:</p>

<pre><code>c, err := DoSomething(foo)
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is much clunkier than the <code>try/catch</code> paradigm most people are used to, and for some that&rsquo;s enough to just scratch the language.</p>

<h2 id="so-when-should-i-use-go">So&hellip; When should I use Go?</h2>

<p>Go is, I believe, a great &ldquo;default&rdquo; language.</p>

<p>What I mean by this is, if you have <em>no real reason</em> to choose a different language, use Go.</p>

<p>Reasons can be many, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to touch bare metal! (C, Rust)</li>
<li>I need to develop faster! (Python, Ruby)</li>
<li>I need to do very complicated things with concurrency in a distributed environment! (Haskell, Clojure, Elixir)</li>
<li>I need to make games! (Python, C, C++)</li>
<li>I need to calculate complex scientific stuff! (Julia, R)</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>So my verdict for Go is this: use Go whenever you don&rsquo;t need a specific language and you value good code over development speed.</p>
