<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">Rust</a> is an amazing language.</p>

<p>True, I say every language is amazing (although begrudgingly with JavaScript), so that may not mean much, but Rust is something special.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a language I could imagine replacing C.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t say that lightly, I&rsquo;m Mr. CFanBoy. C has been in my <strong>Top 5 Languages a Developer Needs to Know</strong> list longer than any other, and the unofficial number 1 in my heart.</p>

<p>But Rust just does everything that C does, except <em>safer</em>. It helps so much to finally have a good low level programming language without worrying every single moment of my life about the dreaded <code>Segmentation Fault</code>.</p>

<p>But enough of that, let&rsquo;s get into it&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="what-is-rust">What is Rust?</h2>

<p>Rust is a language that will confuse you if you&rsquo;ve never touched ML-based languages, because it seems so similar to C but things tend to not compile if you do them 100% &ldquo;the C way&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This is because Rust has taken influence from a weird set of languages, such as C, Haskell and OCaml.</p>

<p>But aside from semantics and syntax, Rust focuses on a <em>safe, concurrent, practical</em> language.</p>

<p>Once again, just like in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go">Go</a>, Rust prevents us from really screwing up memory unless we really want to. But then we have to mark the code as <code>unsafe</code>.</p>

<p>Since Rust is kind enough to write down their greatest features in their website, we will talk about them one by one:</p>

<ol>
<li>zero-cost abstractions</li>
<li>move semantics</li>
<li>guaranteed memory safety</li>
<li>threads without data races</li>
<li>trait-based generics</li>
<li>pattern matching</li>
<li>type inference</li>
<li>minimal runtime</li>
<li>efficient C bindings</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="zero-cost-abstractions">Zero-Cost Abstractions</h3>

<p>Rust attempts to obey the C++ mantra:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>C++ implementations obey the zero-overhead principle: What you don’t use, you don’t pay for [Stroustrup, 1994]. And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.</p>

<p>– Stroustrup</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it succeeds beautifully thanks to <strong>Traits</strong>.</p>

<p>Traits are essentially Interfaces, ways to define a certain number of expected behaviours that a Type complies with. And since they are compiled away, this means that, very much like C++, any calls to a Trait method are zero-cost.</p>

<p>However they are also types and can be used as an element in a struct through indirection if you need to dynamically call a method for an type unknown at compile time.</p>

<p>So somehow, Rust has managed to actually get the best of both worlds here&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="move-semantics">Move Semantics</h3>

<p>This is a weird one for people not used to the idea: in Rust you usually move rather than copy values.</p>

<p>This means that this would result in a compiler error:</p>

<pre><code>let v = Box::new(5);
println!(&quot;{}&quot;, v);
let v2 = v;
println!(&quot;{}&quot;, v);
</code></pre>

<p>Why? Because v has been moved to v2 and you can no longer use v.</p>

<p>Now that seems annoying, right? But don&rsquo;t worry! If you need to just lend a value instead of move it completely, you can just do a &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; by instead using <code>&amp;v</code>.
And if you need to be able to modify the value, use <code>&amp;mut v</code>.</p>

<p>What this entails is that we can always know where we can access a variable from, which is the key that brings us to our next section:</p>

<h3 id="guaranteed-memory-safety">Guaranteed Memory Safety</h3>

<p>Read that again. Guaranteed. Memory. Safety. It&rsquo;s ok if you cry a little.</p>

<p>If that didn&rsquo;t blow your mind, this will: Rust uses no Garbage Collection.
And this, like many of the beautiful things of rust, is due to the move semantics.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s simple, values can be moved or borrowed, but once they live out their scope, they are destroyed. Period.</p>

<p>At first it can sound scary, but really, it just means that whenever you want a value to be in a certain scope, you just move it there.</p>

<p>It also means that for 99% of things you won&rsquo;t need to ever create a Close or Destroy function :)</p>

<h3 id="threads-without-data-races">Threads Without Data Races</h3>

<p>Again Move Semantics to the rescue! Since a value can only be owned by a single scope (and thus a single thread), there are no ownership problems, but that&rsquo;s not all!</p>

<p>Remember <code>&amp;v</code> and <code>&amp;mut v</code>? Well, at compile time Rust makes sure that there can never exist a <code>&amp;mut v</code> (read/write) reference when there is ANY other kind of reference to the object. However, any number of <code>&amp;v</code> (read) references can coexist.</p>

<p>This mean no race conditions. Whoa.</p>

<h3 id="trait-based-generics">Trait-based generics</h3>

<p>We already touched on this, but the key here is very simple: you can use Traits as Types that satisfy an Interface. Which means that you can declare a function for all of those Types at once.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>fn print_hash&lt;T: Hash&gt;(t: &amp;T) {
    println!(&quot;The hash is {}&quot;, t.hash())
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>t</code> can be a borrow (note the <code>&amp;</code>) of any Type which implements the Hash Trait.</p>

<h3 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h3>

<p>Everything is an expression in Rust. This mean this is valid code:</p>

<pre><code>let (x, y, z) = (5, &quot;Potatoes&quot;, false);
</code></pre>

<p>And that you can declare functions such as:</p>

<pre><code>fn compare_hash&lt;T: Hash&gt;(t: &amp;T, t2: &amp;T) -&gt; bool
</code></pre>

<p>Where, you guessed right, not only do both t and t2 need to implement Hash, but they must be the same Type.</p>

<h3 id="minimal-runtime">Minimal runtime</h3>

<p>Rust is built on LLVM and it&rsquo;s optimized like crazy. All those weird rules about moving and borrowing, and the way Traits work allow the runtime to be a very efficient thing that pretty much needs to do nothing but some initialization setting up a heap, some guards and backtraces.</p>

<p>This means Rust is stupidly fast. C-levels of fast. Like whoa.</p>

<h3 id="efficient-c-bindings">Efficient C bindings</h3>

<p>Rust is not here to displace C, although it very well might.</p>

<p>The truth is that, especially at low level, most things are C. So interfacing correctly with C is a must, really, if you want to be compatible with the existent way of doing things.</p>

<p>This also means that it&rsquo;s simple to make a Rust extension to a C application, and so I feel like transitioning things from C to Rust is quite a nice process. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2017-March/012088.html">Tor</a> is doing it :)</p>

<h2 id="what-does-rust-suck-at">What does Rust suck at?</h2>

<p>All languages are amazing, but I&rsquo;ve yet to find one that is perfect, and Rust is no exception.</p>

<p>Although its problem are not as glaring as other programming languages which may or may not be called JavaScript, they still exist and must be considered:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rust is hard to learn and master</li>
<li>Rust is young and doesn&rsquo;t have as many libraries as you&rsquo;d want</li>
<li>Not really for the web</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hard-to-learn-and-master">Hard to Learn and Master</h3>

<p>Unless you&rsquo;re lucky (or crazy) enough to already be profficient in an ML language, a C language and a functional language, chances are Rust is gonna look downright weird to you.</p>

<p>You will probably take a couple of months until you finally stop being surprised at random compiler errors for things that you&rsquo;re <em>sure</em> should be working.</p>

<p>This also means you have to be reasonably sure you actually want to use Rust for something before getting on to learn it&hellip;</p>

<p>However, you really should learn Rust anyway, so get on it!</p>

<h3 id="not-enought-libraries">Not enought Libraries!</h3>

<p>The language is young, still, so this will probably be a nonissue in a few years, and a large number of libraries are appearing every day (in part thanks to <a href="https://github.com/redox/redox">Redox</a>, a complete functional OS written in Rust. Yes, I said an OS).</p>

<p>The fact remains that Rust is still in its infancy, and some things just aren&rsquo;t available. You probably can&rsquo;t reasonably create a TripleA game in Rust (yet).</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re building something complex, that might turn you away, although you should consider contributing libraries yourself! :)</p>

<h3 id="not-for-the-web">Not for the web</h3>

<p>Yes, <a href="https://github.com/iron/iron/">Iron</a> exists. You technically CAN develop a Web App in Rust. But really, should you? It&rsquo;s not designed for it. At all.</p>

<p>And this is probably its greatest problem nowadays, since 90% of everything being done is in the Web&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="so-when-should-i-use-rust">So&hellip; When should I use Rust?</h2>

<p>If you need to create a fast, robust, complex app, Rust has your back.</p>

<p>Need a new accounting program? Rust.
Something to coordinate signals between different programs? Rust.
A driver for that new piece of hardware your company has been building? Rust, please, the world will thank you for it.</p>

<p>Rust: the safe, fast, concurrent language.</p>
